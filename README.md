### Description
This python script is designed to help a company with analyzing their financial records over a given period of time. The data is provided in the [budget_data.csv](PyBank/budget_data.csv) file. This dataset is composed of two columns, Date and Profit/Losses. The python script analyzes and calculates:

* The total number of months included in the dataset.
* The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.
* The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.
* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.
* The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

The analysis is printed into the terminal, and the results are exported into a text file with the results.
